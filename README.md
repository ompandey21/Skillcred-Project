# Analysing the Effectiveness of Promos for an OTT Streaming Platform

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the effectiveness of promotional campaigns for an OTT (Over-The-Top) streaming platform. By leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, I have performed data analysis using Excel and created an interactive dashboard using HTML and CSS to visualize the findings.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about various promotional campaigns run by the OTT platform, including details such as:

- Campaign IDs
- Dates of the campaigns
- Number of users targeted
- Number of users engaged
- Conversion rates
- Revenue generated

## Tools and Technologies

- **Excel**: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **HTML & CSS**: Used to create a dynamic dashboard for visualizing the results.

## Key Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Imported the dataset into Excel and performed necessary cleaning operations such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data for analysis.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated key metrics such as average conversion rates, total revenue, and user engagement rates to get an overall picture of the campaign performance.

3. **Trend Analysis**: Analyzed trends over time to identify patterns in user engagement and conversion rates across different promotional periods.

4. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated the relationships between different variables, such as the number of users targeted and the revenue generated, to understand which factors most significantly impact campaign success.

5. **Visualization**: Developed an interactive dashboard using HTML and CSS to present the analysis results. The dashboard includes charts and graphs that provide insights into the effectiveness of the promotional campaigns.

## Dashboard

The interactive dashboard provides the following visualizations:

- **User Engagement Over Time**: A line chart showing the trend of user engagement across different promotional periods.
- **Conversion Rates by Campaign**: A bar chart displaying the conversion rates for each campaign.
- **Revenue Analysis**: A pie chart highlighting the revenue distribution across various campaigns.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: A heatmap showing the correlation between different campaign metrics.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ompandey21/Skillcred-Project.git

2. **Open the Dashboard**: Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in a web browser to view the interactive dashboard.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of promotional campaigns for an OTT streaming platform. By analyzing the data and visualizing the results, we can make informed decisions to optimize future campaigns for better user engagement and higher conversion rates.
